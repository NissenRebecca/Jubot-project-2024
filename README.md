The goal of the Jubot project, as a preliminary study to a larger robot study, was to find out how the gait pattern changes when additional weight is added to the body. 
This helps to gain early insight into how long it takes to adapt to additional weight, and then to apply these findings to the actual robot.
Various kinematic parameters such as knee joint angle and center of gravity were examined.
